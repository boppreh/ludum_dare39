Top-down shooter-like. Base is under attack. Player controls a unit produced by the base/factory with respawn. Movement depletes energy (low FPS, pixelated, corner shadows, quieter sound). Only attack available is self-destruct. Explosion power is proportional to remaining power (so if attackers get too close the explosions are automatically more useful). Depleted or abandoned units that didn't self-destruct become (destructible) walls to hinder movement. Buyable upgrades. Different enemy types. Waves. Explosions push objects. Colored circles versus other geometrical shapes. Absorb energy from abandoned units. Goal is to destroy enemy base. Screen immitates a radar screen. Upgrades are achievement-based ("you ran past 10 enemies without touching them, +30% movement speed", "destroyed 5 enemies in one explosion, +10% explosion radius").
