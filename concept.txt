Top-down shooter-like. Base is under attack. Player controls a unit produced by the base/factory with respawn. Movement depletes energy (low FPS, pixelated, corner shadows, quieter sound). Only attack available is self-destruct. Explosion power is proportional to remaining power (so if attackers get too close the explosions are automatically more useful). Depleted units that didn't self-destruct become (destructible) walls to hinder movement. Buyable upgrades. Different enemy types. Waves.
